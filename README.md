# Crystal Collector 

##How To Play
When the game loads, a random number bewtween 19 and 120 is chosen and displayed on the screen, as well as four images of crystals. 
Each crystal has a hidden number between 1-12 assigned to it that the user won't know until
they click on one of the crystals. There is also a score counter that starts at 0. Whenever the user presses one of the 
crystals it adds the hidden value of the crystal to the user's score. The goal is to try and make the score equal to 
the random number. If the user makes the numbers equal, the wins counter goes up by 1, if the user goes over ther number,
the losses counter goes up by 1.

Win or lose, the game resets by choosing a new random number and assigning new hidden values to each of the crystals.
